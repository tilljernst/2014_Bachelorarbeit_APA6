	Abstract = {In this research, multitasking with media is defined as an audience behavior that combines media use with another non-media activity. This study examines (a) the prevalence and patterns of multitasking among 14- to 16-year-olds and (b) the media and audience factors that predict such behavior. Consistent with previous research, this study found that youth frequently multitask with media. Both (a) ownership of media in bedrooms as a media factor and (b) sensation seeking as an audience factor were found to be significant predictors of multitasking with media. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are further discussed.},

@article{Watson2010,
	Abstract = {Theory suggests that driving should be impaired for any motorist who is concurrently talking on a cell phone. But is everybody impaired by this dual-task combination? We tested 200 participants in a high-fidelity driving simulator in both single- and dual-task conditions. The dual task involved driving while performing a demanding auditory version of the operation span ({OSPAN)} task. Whereas the vast majority of participants showed significant performance decrements in dual-task conditions (compared with single-task conditions for either driving or {OSPAN} tasks), 2.5\% of the sample showed absolutely no performance decrements with respect to performing single and dual tasks. In single-task conditions, these "supertaskers" scored in the top quartile on all dependent measures associated with driving and {OSPAN} tasks, and Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the frequency of supertaskers was significantly greater than chance. These individual differences help to sharpen our theoretical understanding of attention and cognitive control in naturalistic settings.},

	Abstract = {An information environment is emerging from the simultaneous, rapid, and interconnected evolution of transmission systems, interfaces, and content quantity, quality, and structure. It will be easy to underestimate the collective impact of the sum of these changes on how young people communicate and absorb information. Ultimately, it will be more important to understand how these technologies will facilitate, amplify, or alter the cognitive processes and/or social behavior of the Internet generation. The article analyzes the impact of the following trends on media use and cognition among youthful users: * Information expansion and overload: Accessible networked information will continue to grow at a rapid pace for at least the next 10-20 years. * Rapid increase in interface diffusion: The number of access points into the Internet is expanding in number, variety, and mobility. * Evolution toward more embodied computing: Interfaces are evolving to use more of the sensorimotor system to transfer information to and from the user. * The evolution of more intelligent sensors to interpret use behavior and intentions. * Evolution toward anthropomorphic agent techniques: Computers are evolving to use more social and interpersonal communication techniques to interact with the user.},

	Abstract = {{HCI} is reinventing itself. No longer only about being user-centered, it has set its sights on pastures new, embracing a much broader and far-reaching set of interests. From emotional, eco-friendly, embodied experiences to context, constructivism and culture, {HCI} research is changing apace: from what it looks at, the lenses it uses and what it has to offer. Part of this is as a reaction to what is happening in the world; ubiquitous technologies are proliferating and transforming how we live our lives. We are becoming more connected and more dependent on technology. The home, the cr{\`e}che, outdoors, public places and even the human body are now being experimented with as potential places to embed computational devices, even to the extent of invading previously private and taboo aspects of our lives. In this paper, I examine the diversity of lifestyle and technological transformations in our midst and outline some `difficult' questions these raise together with alternative directions for {HCI} research and practice.},

Drawing on original research, Fisher reveals how women and their natural talents are changing the world, making them ideal leaders and successful shapers of business and society--today and on into the twenty-first {century.Looking} back to prehistoric times, Fisher shows how the special structure of the female brain enables women to do "web thinking" or "synthesis thinking," as compared to men's more linear or "step" thinking. With lively anecdotes and fascinating stories, Fisher reveals how women's special talents--superior verbal abilities, people savvy, acute senses, healing techniques, and more--are geared to success in today's worlds of medicine, education, communications, law, philanthropy, and government. Changes in society--the growth of the communications economy and new trends in family--are also giving women an advantage: women's unique talents are especially needed in our modern {age.This} eye-opening book will change the way you see yourself, your family, and the world around you, including every man and woman you meet.},

	Abstract = {We investigated whether multitasking with media was a unique predictor of depression and social anxiety symptoms. Participants (N=318) completed measures of their media use, personality characteristics, depression, and social anxiety. Regression analyses revealed that increased media multitasking was associated with higher depression and social anxiety symptoms, even after controlling for overall media use and the personality traits of neuroticism and extraversion. The unique association between media multitasking and these measures of psychosocial dysfunction suggests that the growing trend of multitasking with media may represent a unique risk factor for mental health problems related to mood and anxiety. Further, the results strongly suggest that future research investigating the impact of media use on mental health needs to consider the role that multitasking with media plays in the relationship.},

@article{Buhner2006,
	Abstract = {Being able to work on several tasks at the same time (multitasking) is an important performance aspect of many jobs. Recent research findings pointed out the important role of working memory for multitasking performance in general. To understand more about the role of working memory in predicting the speed and the error aspect of multitasking performance, this research was based on a newly developed and well-elaborated multidimensional model of working memory (Oberauer, {SuB}, Wilhelm, \& Wittmann, 2003). Its 3 dimensions are storage in the context of processing, coordination, and supervision. In addition, attention and reasoning were controlled when predicting multitasking speed and error. A multitasking scenario, a battery of working memory tests, a battery of reasoning tests, and 2 attention tests were administered to 135 participants. As expected working memory was the best predictor of multitasking performance, followed by reasoning and attention. Working memory components showed a differential validity when predicting multitasking speed and multitasking error: Multitasking speed was predicted mainly by coordination, and multitasking error mainly by storage in the context of processing. Thus, this study provided a deeper insight into the relevant abilities of multitasking. Implications for personnel selection are discussed.

@article{Dreher2003,
	Abstract = {A fundamental question about the nature of cognitive control is whether performing two tasks successively or simultaneously activates distinct brain regions. To investigate this issue, a functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} study was designed to compare task-switching and dual-task performance among 8 adults. Results showed that performing two tasks successively or simultaneously activated a common prefronto-parietal neural network relative to performing each task separately. More importantly, the anterior cingulate and the lateral prefrontal cortices were found to be differently activated in dual-task and task-switching situations. When performing two tasks simultaneously, as compared to performing them in succession, activation was found in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, switching between two tasks, relative to performing them simultaneously, activated the left lateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral intra-parietal sulcus region. Results are interpreted as indicating that the rostral anterior cingulate cortex serves to resolve conflicts between stimulus-response associations when performing two tasks simultaneously, while the lateral prefrontal cortex dynamically selects the neural pathways needed to perform a given task during task switching.

	Abstract = {This research examined polychronicity, which refers to an individual's preference for working on many things simultaneously as opposed to one at a time. It was hypothesized that supplies--values fit on this temporal variable is related to well-being. Specifically, it was predicted that deficient and excess polychronicity supplies are associated with poorer well-being, and that well-being is uniformly high along the continuum of polychronicity fit. It was also hypothesized that fit effects are stronger for individuals who place high importance on how their time is allocated than for individuals who place low importance on that dimension. Participants in Study 1, a laboratory experiment, were students (N = 266); participants in Study 2, conducted in a field setting, were employees of Canadian organizations (N = 746). No fit effects were observed in Study 1. Consistent with the hypotheses, however, fit on the dimension of polychronicity was related to job satisfaction, self-efficacy, and psychological strain in Study 2. The role of value importance as a moderator of the relation between supplies--values fit and well-being was not supported.},

	Abstract = {The multitasking phenomenon is very prevalent among students. Research on the multitasking phenomenon has either explored the extent to which it exists among students, or assessed the impact of multitasking on students' learning activities through non-voluntary multitasking experiments. However, what causes students to multitask has not received much attention. As multitasking has become a part of students' lives, it is important to understand the possible antecedents and the possible effects of the multitasking phenomenon on students. The purpose of this study is to investigate factors influencing students' multitasking behavior as well as the relationship between multitasking behavior and students' academic achievement. This was accomplished through the lens of polychronicity and behavior studies where polychronicity, sensation seeking, and technology dependence were identified as the predictors of multitasking. Viewpoints from psychology studies, brain studies, and empirical research indicated learning under distractions impairs students learning. 230 usable observations were collected through an online survey. This study adopted a two-step approach in testing the proposed model. Results of the measurement model exhibited appropriate construct validity. Following the measurement model, the structural model suggested polychronicity and sensation seeking were predictors of students' multitasking behavior, whereas technology dependence did not make a significant contribution to students' multitasking behavior. The results of the structural model also suggested that multitasking did impact students' academic performance. However, the impact found in this study contradicted that found in previous research.

Its expression in risky behaviors such as extreme and risky sports, vocations, substance abuse, unsafe sex, and crime, among others, is the topic of this fascinating and accessible book. In {"Sensation} Seeking and Risky Behavior", Marvin Zuckerman offers a comprehensive view of the role of sensation seeking in a wide range of behaviors, from risky driving and sports through substance use, sex, and crime or other antisocial behaviors. How the personality trait sensation seeking relates to these risky behaviors is described and explained in terms of genetics, biology, attitudes, and expectancies. Insights into prevention and treatment of maladaptive forms of sensation seeking, like substance abuse and unsaf sexual activity, based on the published research, are offered.},

The behavioral expressions of sensation seeking have been found in various kinds of risk-taking behaviors such as driving habits, health, gambling, financial activities, alcohol and drug use, sexual behavior, and sports. The trait is also involved in vocational preferences and choices, job satisfaction, social premarital and marital relationships, eating habits and food preferences, media and art preferences, humor, fantasy, creativity, and social attitudes. Its modes of assessment, behavioral expressions, and genetic and psychobiological bases are described by [Marvin Zuckerman]. In the last chapter the author develops a biosocial model for the trait.

	Abstract = {The proliferation and ease of access to information and communication technologies ({ICTs)} such as Facebook, text messaging, and instant messaging has resulted in {ICT} users being presented with more real-time streaming data than ever before. Unfortunately, this has also resulted in individuals increasingly engaging in multitasking as an information management strategy. The purpose of this study was to examine how college students multitask with {ICTs} and to determine the impacts of this multitasking on their college grade point average ({GPA).} Using web survey data from a large sample of college students at one university (N = 1839), we found that students reported spending a large amount of time using {ICTs} on a daily basis. Students reported frequently searching for content not related to courses, using Facebook, emailing, talking on their cell phones, and texting while doing schoolwork. Hierarchical (blocked) linear regression analyses revealed that using Facebook and texting while doing schoolwork were negatively associated with overall college {GPA.} Engaging in Facebook use or texting while trying to complete schoolwork may tax students' capacity for cognitive processing and preclude deeper learning. Our research indicates that the type and purpose of {ICT} use matters in terms of the educational impacts of multitasking.},

@article{Roberts2008,
	Abstract = {American youth are awash in media. They have television sets in their bedrooms, personal computers in their family rooms, and digital music players and cell phones in their backpacks. They spend more time with media than any single activity other than sleeping, with the average American eight- to eighteen-year-old reporting more than six hours of daily media use. The growing phenomenon of "media multitasking"--using several media concurrently--multiplies that figure to eight and a half hours of media exposure daily. Donald Roberts and Ulla Foehr examine how both media use and media exposure vary with demographic factors such as age, race and ethnicity, and household socioeconomic status, and with psychosocial variables such as academic performance and personal adjustment. They note that media exposure begins early, increases until children begin school, drops off briefly, then climbs again to peak at almost eight hours daily among eleven- and twelve-year-olds. Television and video exposure is particularly high among African American youth. Media exposure is negatively related to indicators of socioeconomic status, but that relationship may be diminishing. Media exposure is positively related to risk-taking behaviors and is negatively related to personal adjustment and school performance. Roberts and Foehr also review evidence pointing to the existence of a digital divide--variations in access to personal computers and allied technologies by socioeconomic status and by race and ethnicity. The authors also examine how the recent emergence of digital media such as personal computers, video game consoles, and portable music players, as well as the media multitasking phenomenon they facilitate, has increased young people's exposure to media messages while leaving media use time largely unchanged. Newer media, they point out, are not displacing older media but are being used in concert with them. The authors note which young people are more or less likely to use several media concurrently and which media are more or less likely to be paired with various other media. They argue that one implication of such media multitasking is the need to reconceptualize "media exposure."},

This research examined the social and psychological impact of the Internet on 169 people in 73 households during their first 1 to 2 years on-line. We used longitudinal data to examine the effects of the Internet on social involvement and psychological well-being. In this sample, the Internet was used extensively for communication. Nonetheless, greater use of the Internet was associated with declines in participants' communication with family members in the household, declines in the size of their social circle, and increases in their depression and loneliness.

	N2 = {The pursuit of happiness is an important goal for many people. However, surprisingly little scientific research has focused on the question of how happiness can be increased and then sustained, probably because of pessimism engendered by the concepts of genetic determinism and hedonic adaptation. Nevertheless, emerging sources of optimism exist regarding the possibility of permanent increases in happiness. Drawing on the past well-being literature, the authors propose that a person's chronic happiness level is governed by 3 major factors: a genetically determined set point for happiness, happiness-relevant circumstantial factors, and happiness-relevant activities and practices. The authors then consider adaptation and dynamic processes to show why the activity category offers the best opportunities for sustainably increasing happiness. Finally, existing research is discussed in support of the model, including 2 preliminary happiness-increasing interventions.},

	Abstract = {The ability to remain focused on goal-relevant stimuli in the presence of potentially interfering distractors is crucial for any coherent cognitive function. However, simply instructing people to ignore goal-irrelevant stimuli is not sufficient for preventing their processing. Recent research reveals that distractor processing depends critically on the level and type of load involved in the processing of goal-relevant information. Whereas high perceptual load can eliminate distractor processing, high load on "frontal" cognitive control processes increases distractor processing. These findings provide a resolution to the long-standing early and late selection debate within a load theory of attention that accommodates behavioural and neuroimaging data within a framework that integrates attention research with executive function.},

The study compared 9 age groups (6, 8, 10, 13, 16, 24, 35, 45, 57 years) on verbal and visuospatial WM performance under initial (no probes or cues), gain (cues that bring performance to an asymptotic level), and maintenance conditions (asymptotic conditions without cues). (a) Age-related performance differences in WM were found across all conditions and were not isolated to specific processes, (b) significant performance differences remained among age groups on gain and maintenance conditions, and (c) the gain (accessing new information) and maintenance conditions (maintenance of old information) for verbal and visuospatial WM tasks contributed independent variance to age-related performance. The results support a general capacity explanation of age-related differences. These differences in capacity reflect demands placed on both the accessing of new information and the maintenance of old information.},

Separate modeling for part-time (n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;147) and full-time students (n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;409) showed that this mediation was moderated by enrollment status. Thus, time management was a significant mediator for part-time students but not for full-time students. The greater importance of time management for part- versus full-time students suggests that noncognitive constructs such as time management may be more critical for non-traditional students. These findings gather fresh currency as ever increasing numbers of students are enrolling part-time in post-secondary education across the globe.},

	Abstract = {(from the cover) The Collected Works of Ed Diener, in 3 volumes, present the major works of the leading psychologist studying happiness and well-being. Professor Diener has studied subjective well-being, people's life satisfaction and positive emotions, for over a quarter of a century, and has published 200 works on the topic, many more than any other scholar. He has studied hundreds of thousands of people in over 140 nations of the world, and the Collected Works present the major findings from those studies. Diener has made many of the major discoveries about well-being, which are outlined in the chapters. This third volume on measurement is the most applied and practical one because it discusses all the measures used, and presents new measures. Even for those who do not want to study well-being per se, but want to use some well-being measures in their research, this volume will be of enormous help.

Research reviewed in this article probes the control processes that reconfigure mental resources for a change of task by requiring subjects to switch frequently among a small set of simple tasks. Subjects' responses are substantially slower and, usually, more error-prone immediately after a task switch. This ‚{\"A}{\`o}switch cost‚{\"A}{\^o} is reduced, but not eliminated, by an opportunity for preparation. It seems to result from both transient and long-term carry-over of ‚{\"A}{\`o}task-set‚{\"A}{\^o} activation and inhibition as well as time consumed by task-set reconfiguration processes. Neuroimaging studies of task switching have revealed extra activation in numerous brain regions when subjects prepare to change tasks and when they perform a changed task, but we cannot yet separate ‚{\"A}{\`o}controlling‚{\"A}{\^o} from ‚{\"A}{\`o}controlled‚{\"A}{\^o} regions.},
